- experiment.html: shows the instructions of the experiments and the twelve plots (six per stage)
- source.js: functionality of experiment.html, i.e. data collection and delivery


## Data analysis

This is still empty:

- bayesian-forecasting-export.json: raw data of participants, as exported from Firebase
- analyze.py: the classes and functions to analyze the raw data
